Mapeteria lets people generate KML files or Google Maps mashups that have territories colored based on data they provide.

Specifically, users give Mapeteria a spreadsheet file (CSV initially) that associates identifiers of areas (e.g. us,vt for Vermont or ca,mb for Manitoba) with an attribute value for that area (e.g. 12 or 24.5).  The attribute represents some data of interest, like number of floss recycling plants in that area, or the population density of that area.

Mapeteria keeps track of the geometries and also does the color mapping.  The user doesn't have to know anything about vertices, nor how to convert an attribute like 12 or 24.5 into a color like #eef7a206.

Exception to the license: use of the French shape information must attribute the creators of that information.
